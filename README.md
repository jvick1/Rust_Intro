# Rust_Intro

Welcome to Rust_Intro, your gateway to learning Rust! This guide will walk you through the process of installing Rust, setting up your initial projects, and provide step-by-step instructions for understanding the basics of Rust programming.

## Installation

Start your Rust journey by installing Rust on your system. Visit [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the installation instructions. The images below illustrate the installation process:

## Setup

Once the installation is complete, you'll find a new terminal pop-up. If not, run the executable manually. The image below demonstrates this process:

## Your First Project

Let's dive into creating your first Rust project. Open a new terminal, navigate to your desired working directory, and execute the following commands:

### Windows Command Prompt:

- Navigate back: `cd..`
- Change to a specific path: `cd /c:/path`
- List files and directories: `dir`
- Change to a different drive: `E:`

### Linux/macOS Terminal:

- Navigate back: `cd ..`
- Change to a specific path: `cd /path`
- List files and directories: `ls`

Now, create a new project named "hello" by typing:

```bash
cargo new hello
```

## Running Your Code
Enter the project directory with:

```bash
cd hello
```

Run the project:

```bash
cargo run
```

Your terminal should display "Hello, world!" as the output:

## Understanding Cargo

1. `Cargo:` Think of it as Rust's package manager, similar to Pip for Python or npm for JavaScript. But Cargo is moreâ€”it's also the build system, test runner, docs generator, and more. Check the version with:

```bash
cargo --version
```
   
2. `Hello, world! Code:` You'll find the code responsible for printing "Hello, world!" in `hello/src/main.rs`.
