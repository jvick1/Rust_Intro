# Intro

If you type `cargo new hello` on your machine with Rust installed this new project will be created. 

The dir will look somethinglike this:

hello/

- Cargo.toml

- src/main.rs

## Cargo.toml
In Rust, the Cargo.toml file is a configuration file used by Cargo, which is Rust's package manager and build system. The Cargo.toml file is an essential part of a Rust project, and it contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.
